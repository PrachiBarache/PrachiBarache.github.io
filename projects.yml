# Project data for portfolio

- title: SimpleRAG - Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation System
  description: >-
    Developed a compact RAG system to extract information from PDF documents and answer natural 
    language queries. Implemented vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers and FAISS for 
    efficient similarity search, and integrated TinyLlama (1.1B parameters) for generation. 
    Engineered a modular architecture with custom text chunking strategies and context window 
    management for optimal information retrieval.
  tech: [Python, Transformers, PyTorch, FAISS, Vector Databases]

- title: Financial Sentiment Analysis Project
  description: >-
    Developed a financial sentiment analysis system comparing transformer-based models 
    (BERT, RoBERTa) with traditional machine learning approaches (SVM, RNN) to classify 
    financial news as positive, negative, or neutral. Implemented and fine-tuned multiple 
    model architectures, achieving 95% accuracy with RoBERTa compared to 83% with SVM.

- title: Wine Quality Prediction
  description: >-
    Implemented machine learning models to predict customer subscription to bank term deposits, 
    improving telemarketing campaign effectiveness. Implemented and compared SVM and MLP models on 
    highly imbalanced dataset (88:12 ratio), achieving 85.49% accuracy. Addressed class imbalance 
    using SMOTE and undersampling techniques, optimizing for minority class prediction.
  tech: [Python, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, SMOTE]

- title: Online Retail Sales Pattern Analysis
  description: >-
    Implemented visual analytics approach on an online retail dataset containing 25,900+ transactions 
    from 5,941 customers over one year. Processed and visualized sales data using Python to identify 
    seasonal patterns, revealing 37% higher sales in Q4 and order cancellation trends. Performed product 
    segmentation to identify top-selling items for inventory optimization.
  tech: [Python, Data Visualization, Pandas, Linear Regression]

- title: Optimal Navigation in a Zoo Environment
  description: >-
    Developed an advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning project creating an intelligent agent for 
    optimal navigation in a complex zoo environment. Implemented and compared multiple RL algorithms 
    including Q-Learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with 
    key improvements like Dueling DQN and Prioritized Experience Replay.
